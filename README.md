# JAVA
I have developed all the programming logic using this language .The reason for choosing this language is its secured, robust and portable nature.

#JDBC 
Here in my project , I have used JDBC as an API ,which works as a bridge to provide communication between Java Application and Database System.

#MySQL
I have used MySQL for storing all the schemas like-
Customer Details : Account_ID , Cust_Name , Cust_Balance.
Transaction Details: Account_Id , Balance , Deposits , Withdrawl
